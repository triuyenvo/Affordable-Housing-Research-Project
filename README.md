# Licking County Housing Development  Affordable Housing
The Licking County Housing Affordability project is undertaken by the Real Estate team. The project's primary focus is to determine the demographic group most affected by the issue of Housing Affordability and identify the factors that contribute to this problem.
Motivation
By collecting and analyzing data, we aim to equip our client, the Licking County Coalition for Housing, with valuable insights that will enable them to better support their community's residents. With this information, the coalition can develop more effective approaches to address the issue of housing affordability, ultimately helping those who need it most.
